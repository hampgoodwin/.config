# .config

my dot files


## Dependencies

Install NVM to manage node versions, then install a global node version. This will allow our mason.nvim to install tsserver, eslint_d and prettier_d.
Install Go.
Install Rust.


## Usage

Create a symlink from you $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zsh/.zshenv to your $HOME/.zshenv . Unfortunately zsh will only look for this env file in the home directory. However, once it is in place, everything else should work well!
